How like to help?

**Yeah, thanks.**

First you need to get used to the [GitHub Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).  
Second Make a Pull Request to add a Webpage to the list. Please only one URL per PR. Or make a PR to Assist with the Syntax. To Change pure Links to Text and Link.

While I try to keep control on that list and not having dead link in it, please to not add 800 pages at a time.  
It is understood, that this page won't be complete at any time and is always a snapshot or some pages. There are as well other resources out there, that are great and not in the list.
